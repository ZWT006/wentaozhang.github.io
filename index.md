# Wentao Zhang (张文涛)

My research lies in the intersection of robotics, control, optimization, and learning. My research goal is to build secure, intelligent, and autonomous robot systems assisting humans in hazardous and labor-intensive tasks. I have undertaken various projects related to autonomous driving, unmanned aerial vehicles, legged locomotion, and swarm robotics.
